            <p>Borley Rectory, often referred to as the most haunted house in England, was a Gothic-style Victorian mansion located in the village of Borley, Essex. It gained fame for its alleged paranormal activity, which attracted significant attention from paranormal investigators and the media.</p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>The rectory was built in 1862 by Reverend Henry Dawson Ellis Bull. It served as a residence for the rector of Borley Parish and his family. Paranormal activity was reported as early as the late 19th century. Residents and visitors claimed to have seen ghostly apparitions, heard unexplained noises, and experienced other strange phenomena.</p>

                <li>Harry Price's Investigations: One of the most famous investigators, Harry Price, conducted several investigations in the 1930s. He documented his findings in books and articles, which contributed to the rectory's reputation.
