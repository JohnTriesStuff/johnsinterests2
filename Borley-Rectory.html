            <h2>Borley Rectory</h2>
            <img src="images/BorleyRectory.jpg" alt="Borley Rectory" class="center-img">
            <p>Borley Rectory, often referred to as the most haunted house in England, was a Gothic-style Victorian mansion located in the village of Borley, Essex. It gained fame for its alleged paranormal activity, which attracted significant attention from paranormal investigators and the media.</p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>The rectory was built in 1862 by Reverend Henry Dawson Ellis Bull. It served as a residence for the rector of Borley Parish and his family. Paranormal activity was reported as early as the late 19th century. Residents and visitors claimed to have seen ghostly apparitions, heard unexplained noises, and experienced other strange phenomena.</p>
            <h3>Reverend Bull And The Haunting</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The first reports of paranormal activity began shortly after the Bull family moved into the rectory. According to local lore, a ghostly nun was often seen wandering the grounds. She would glide silently through the garden, her face hidden beneath a dark veil. It was said that this nun was a member of a nearby convent who had been bricked up alive in the walls of the rectory after breaking her vows. The spectral figure would vanish into thin air when approached.
</li>
                <li>Reverend Bull himself reportedly saw the ghostly nun on several occasions and even built a summerhouse overlooking the area where she was most frequently seen. After his death, his successor, Reverend Smith, and his wife also experienced numerous paranormal events. Mrs. Smith once found a package of the reverend's clothes inexplicably strewn across the hallway, and on another occasion, she was nearly struck by a stone that flew out of nowhere.
.</li>
                <li>The rectory itself seemed to be alive with strange and inexplicable sounds. Late at night, the Bull family and their guests would hear the distinct sound of footsteps echoing through the empty hallways. Doors would creak open and slam shut by themselves, as if moved by unseen hands. These disturbances were particularly unsettling in the dead of night, when the house was otherwise silent.
.</li>
                <li>Another recurring phenomenon was the appearance of a phantom coach. Witnesses described hearing the distant rumble of carriage wheels and the clatter of horses' hooves on cobblestones, growing louder and louder until it seemed to be right outside the rectory. Those brave enough to look outside would see an old-fashioned coach, drawn by a team of spectral horses, careening through the grounds before vanishing into the darkness.

As the years went by, the hauntings grew more intense. Objects would move of their own accord, sometimes flying across rooms with violent force. Stones and bricks would be thrown through the air, seemingly from nowhere. The Bull children often found their toys inexplicably moved or broken. One of the most unsettling manifestations was the appearance of strange, scrawled messages on the walls, written in a childlike hand.

            <h3>Ghost Writings and Harry Price</h3>
            <p>The ghost writings at Borley Rectory first gained attention during the tenancy of the Foyster family in the early 1930s. Marianne Foyster, the wife of the rector, reported finding numerous messages written on the walls. These writings often took the form of pleas for help, such as "Marianne, please help get" and "Rest." The messages appeared in various parts of the house, often in areas that were difficult to reach, adding to the mystery.

News of the hauntings at Borley Rectory quickly spread, drawing the attention of the public and paranormal investigators alike. In 1929, the Daily Mirror newspaper sent a reporter to investigate the rectory, and they enlisted the help of Harry Price, a well-known paranormal researcher. Price's investigations brought even more attention to the haunted rectory. He conducted séances, experiments, and detailed observations, all of which seemed to confirm the presence of supernatural entities.

He organized séances and experiments, capturing what he believed were genuine supernatural occurrences. His investigations at Borley Rectory were widely publicized, significantly contributing to its reputation as the most haunted house in England.

Price documented his findings in books and articles, with his work on Borley Rectory becoming some of the most famous and controversial in the field of paranormal research. Despite skepticism and criticism from some quarters, Harry Price's association with Borley Rectory remains a cornerstone of his legacy in the study of the supernatural.

Price's investigations into Borley Rectory's ghost writings are among the most intriguing aspects of his work. These mysterious writings appeared on the walls of the rectory and were a key piece of evidence for Price's claims of paranormal activity.
